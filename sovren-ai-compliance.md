# **Compliance Guidelines Document for Sovren AI**

This document defines the **non-negotiable compliance standards** for Sovren AI, ensuring **absolute alignment with global laws, sovereign enforcement, and future-proof governance**. These measures guarantee Sovren AI operates with **integrity, transparency, and sovereignty**, while instilling trust at Fortune-50 and national-defense levels.

---

## **1\. Core Compliance Frameworks**

* **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)** – Full compliance for EU user data: right-to-access, right-to-erasure, portability, consent management.

* **CCPA (California Consumer Privacy Act)** – Supports “Do Not Sell/Share My Data” workflows for California residents.

* **HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)** – Enforced where PHI is processed; full audit, breach notification, and minimum necessary principle applied.

* **PCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)** – End-to-end compliance for all Stripe-powered payment workflows.

* **SOC 2 Type II** – Continuous monitoring of operational and security controls.

* **ISO 27001** – Formalized ISMS (Information Security Management System).

* **ISO/IEC 42001:2023 (AI Management Systems)** – Adopted for responsible AI governance.

* **EU AI Act (2025+)** – Sovren AI categorized as “high-risk AI system” → aligned with transparency, oversight, and record-keeping mandates.

* **NIST AI RMF (Risk Management Framework)** – Risk identification, accountability, and mitigation lifecycle.

* **LGPD (Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados – Brazil)** – Data subject rights, local data handling rules, and cross-border transfer restrictions.

* **PIPL (Personal Information Protection Law – China)** – Explicit consent, local storage mandates, and state audit readiness.

---

## **2\. Zero-Trust Security Posture**

* **No implicit trust** → every session, request, and identity revalidated.

* **Microsegmentation** – isolates services to prevent lateral attack spread.

* **Just-in-time access** – temporary credentials issued, auto-expired.

* **Default-deny escalation** – no privilege granted without multi-party approval.

---

## **3\. Authentication & Authorization**

* **OAuth 2.0** with PKCE for trusted clients.

* **JWTs (RS256)** – expiry ≤ 15 minutes; refresh tokens rotated and revocable.

* **RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)** – matrix enforced at API and DB layers.

* **MFA (Multi-Factor Authentication)** – mandatory for admins and executives.

* **Geo-fencing** – critical functions only from approved sovereign networks.

---

## **4\. Data Validation & Protection**

* **Validation frameworks** (Joi/Yup) block SQLi, XSS, CSRF at ingestion.

* **Strict type/boundary checks** – size, length, numeric limits enforced.

* **Minimization** – no excess PII collected.

* **Encryption at Rest** – AES-256 for databases, Vault/HSM key storage.

* **Encryption in Transit** – TLS 1.3 enforced.

* **Quantum-Resistant Roadmap** – CRYSTALS-Kyber/Dilithium pilot programs staged.

---

## **5\. Data Retention & Deletion**

* **Default Retention** – PII kept only while contractual relationship exists.

* **Auto-Purge Schedule** – All inactive accounts deleted within **30 days** of termination unless retention mandated by law.

* **Immutable Logs** – Kept for **7 years** (for regulatory/legal audits), stored encrypted and blockchain-anchored.

* **Anonymization Pipeline** – user data tokenized after operational need ends.

---

## **6\. Rate Limiting & Abuse Prevention**

* **Per-endpoint throttling** (e.g., 1000 requests/minute).

* **User-level quotas** – enforced to stop brute-force or API flooding.

* **Adaptive AI-based throttling** – traffic patterns analyzed for anomalies.

---

## **7\. Error Handling & Logging**

* **User-facing errors** – sanitized, no stack traces exposed.

* **Internal logs** – full error detail, restricted to security engineers.

* **Immutable audit logs** – blockchain-anchored, cryptographically signed.

---

## **8\. Security Headers & HTTPS**

* **CORS** – locked to trusted origins only.

* **CSP** – strict nonce-based execution.

* **HSTS** – long-lived HTTPS enforcement.

* **TLS Certificates** – rotated automatically, downtime-free.

---

## **9\. Dependency & Supply Chain Security**

* **Automated scanning** – Snyk, Dependabot, sovereign scanner stack.

* **Weekly patch cycles** – all dependencies tested pre-deployment.

* **Cryptographic verification** – signed builds only; no unsigned binaries.

---

## **10\. Monitoring & Continuous Compliance**

* **Tooling** – Datadog, Sentry, Grafana, SIEM pipelines.

* **Continuous compliance scans** – automated daily checks across all services.

* **AI-driven risk scoring** – models score compliance posture, alert on drift.

* **Immutable audit trails** – blockchain-backed, tamper-proof.

* **Quarterly manual review** – Founder/Compliance Officer sign-off required.

---

## 

## **11\. Vendor & Third-Party Risk Management**

* **Stripe** – PCI-DSS L1 verified.

* **Other vendors** – annual audit \+ breach watchlist monitoring.

* **Vendor risk scoring** – continuous monitoring for compliance degradation.

---

## **12\. Incident Response & Breach Protocols**

* **Detection SLA** – \< 1 minute via anomaly detectors.

* **Containment SLA** – \< 5 minutes isolation of workloads.

* **Notification SLA** – GDPR 72-hour rule, mirrored for global regulators.

* **Forensic capture** – chain-of-custody logs auto-snapshotted.

* **Quarterly drills** – red-team breach simulations validated.

---

## **13\. Workforce Compliance Training**

* **Quarterly mandatory sessions** for all Sovren AI staff.

* Covers GDPR, HIPAA, AI ethics, insider threat prevention, data handling.

* **Zero-tolerance policy** – missed training \= credential suspension.

---

## 

## 

## 

## **14\. Regulatory Change Automation**

* **Watchdogs** – AI monitors for changes in GDPR, AI Act, HIPAA, LGPD, PIPL, etc.

* **Compliance delta reports** – weekly diff on legal obligations.

* **Automated alerts** – legal/compliance officers notified within 24 hours of regulatory change detection.

---

## **15\. Non-Negotiable Standards**

* **Zero placeholders** – all compliance code/features production-ready before merge.

* **Audit readiness by default** – every subsystem passes simulated audit quarterly.

* **Failure \= rollback** – non-compliant code cannot enter production.

---

## **Conclusion**

By enforcing **global frameworks (GDPR, HIPAA, CCPA, LGPD, PIPL, PCI-DSS, ISO, AI Act, NIST)**, embedding **zero-trust security**, **immutable retention controls**, **quarterly training**, and **regulatory change automation**, Sovren AI establishes itself as the **world’s most compliance-hardened AI system**.

It is not reactive — it is **future-immune**, capable of adapting instantly to new laws, while projecting **absolute sovereignty, trust, and resilience**.

`import { deleteUserData, logAudit } from "./compliance"`

`async function handleGDPRDelete(userId: string) {`
