- **Backend**: Implement JWT verification middleware in FastAPI/Django.

## 3. Build Frontend Pages

### Order of Page Creation
1. **Authentication Pages**: Login, Signup, and Password Recovery.
2. **Dashboard**: Main user interface with navigation and analytics dashboard.
3. **Command Center**: 3D WebGL Holographic Command Center.
4. **Profile Management**: User account and profile settings.
5. **Subscription Management**: Manage plans and billing.
6. **Notifications**: Notification center for alerts and updates.

### Component Dependencies
- **Navigation Bar**: Common across all pages.
- **Sidebar**: For quick access to different sections.
- **Footer**: Consistent footer across all pages.

## 4. Create Backend Endpoints

### API Development Sequence
1. **Auth Endpoints**: User registration, login, logout, and token refresh.
2. **User Management**: CRUD operations on user profiles.
3. **Executive Management**: APIs for managing AI executives.
4. **Deal Processing**: Endpoints for deal negotiation and closure.
5. **Analytics and Reporting**: Data retrieval for dashboards.

## 5. Connect Frontend â†” Backend

### API Integration
- **Axios/Fetch**: For making HTTP requests from React.
- **State Management**: Use Redux for managing global state.

### State Management Setup
- **Configure Redux Store**: Set up reducers and actions.
- **Thunk Middleware**: For handling asynchronous actions.

## 6. Add 3rd Party Integrations

### Payment Processing
- **Stripe Integration**: Set up Stripe for subscription management and payment processing.

### Email and Analytics
- **Email Service**: Integrate with services like SendGrid or Mailgun.
- **Analytics**: Use tools like Datadog, New Relic for monitoring and performance analytics.

## 7. Test Features

### Unit Tests
- **Jest**: Write unit tests for React components and services.

### Integration Tests
- **Selenium**: Automate browser testing for user flows.

### End-to-End Tests (E2E)
- **Cypress**: Implement E2E tests for critical paths.

### Test Data Setup
- **Mock Data**: Use fixtures for consistent test data.

## 8. Security Checklist

### Security Measures
- **Data Encryption**: Implement SSL/TLS for data in transit.
- **Input Validation**: Sanitize all user inputs to prevent XSS/SQL Injection.
- **Rate Limiting**: Protect APIs from abuse with rate limiting.
- **Audit Logging**: Maintain logs for all critical operations.
- **GDPR Compliance**: Ensure data handling complies with GDPR.

## 9. Deployment Steps

### Build Process
- **Continuous Integration**: Set up CI/CD pipelines using tools like Jenkins or GitHub Actions.

### Environment Configuration
- **Production Environment**: Set up environment variables for production.
- **Database Setup**: Configure PostgreSQL and Redis for production.

### Hosting Setup
- **Containerization**: Use Docker for containerizing applications.
- **Orchestration**: Deploy using Kubernetes for scalability.
- **Cloud Provider**: Host on cloud services like AWS or GCP.

## 10. Post-Launch Tasks

### Monitoring
- **System Monitoring**: Use tools like Sentry for error tracking.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track performance metrics with Datadog.

### Analytics
- **User Behavior**: Collect user interaction data for insights.
- **Feedback Collection**: Implement feedback forms for user input.

### Continuous Improvement
- **Iterate Features**: Continuously improve based on user feedback.
- **Security Updates**: Regularly update dependencies and security patches.
